1.1 Problem Statement
Given the price of a stock in last few years, the project aims to predict a signal
that indicates whether buying the stock will be profitable in future or not.
1.2 Scope of the project
•Data collection and preprocessing Gathering historical stock price
data and preprocessing it to ensure it is clean and ready for analysis.
•Feature Engineering Deriving new features from the existing ones to
gain deeper insights into the data and improve model performance.
•Model Selection and evaluation Training and evaluating multiple
state-of-the-art machine learning models to determine which one performs
best on the given dataset.
•Performance evaluation Continuously monitoring the model’s perfor-
mance and making necessary adjustments to maintain its accuracy over
time.
